<h3><a id="A"></a>About Department of Mathmatics</h3>
          <p><a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/index/?lang=en" target="_blank">
                   The SUSTech Mathematics Department</a>  was founded in June 2015. As of the 2022 - 2023 academic year, the Department consists of 42 research and teaching-line faculty members and 10 teaching-line faculty members, 267 graduate students, and 146 undergraduate majors. The Department is currently located in the College of Science Building, 1088 Xueyuan Avenue. Our administrative office is situated in Room M715 on the seventh floor.
          </p><p>
 
Our graduate program (master and doctoral) covers nearly all fields of mathematical sciences. In addition, the Department also has joint Ph.D. programs with a few well-known overseas and Hong Kong/Macao universities providing excellent opportunities for prospective students.

          </p><p>
Our faculty members’ research covers a broad range of areas including Mathematics (dynamical systems, algebra and combinatorics, algebraic number theory, PDEs, mathematical physics and differential geometry, etc.), Computational and Applied Mathematics (applied mathematics, numerical analysis, computational fluid dynamics, scientific computing, inverse problems, data science, etc.), Probability and Statistics, and Financial Mathematics.
<!-- 
<p><p>
The Department enjoys an outstanding faculty. Most of our senior faculty members have had tenured positions in leading Universities in the US, Canada, Australia, and European Countries. Most of our junior faculty have had multiple years of teaching and research experiences overseas, after receiving their degrees in some of the top universities in the world. Our faculty members have been invited to speak at major international conferences such as ICM, obtained distinguished honors such as membership to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and National Science Award, serve on the editorial boards of more than 30 international research journals, and published in prestigious journals such as Annals of Mathematics, Inventiones Mathematicae, JAMS, and Acta.

<p><p>
As the Department continues to grow, we are actively recruiting new faculty members, postdocs, visitors and graduate students. We welcome outstanding candidates to join us in our exciting journey to become a world class mathematical department.

     <h3><a id="R"></a>About Center</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://icm.sustech.edu.cn/page/about?lang=en-us" target="_blank">
                   The SUSTech International Center for Mathematics</a> 
  , officially established on February 22, 2019, is a scientific research center funded by Shenzhen Municipal Government and located in Southern University of Science and Technology. The Scientific Director is Fields Medalist Efim Zelmanov.
 </p><p>
It aims to advance scientific research in pure mathematics as well as applied and computational mathematics in Shenzhen, the Pearl River Delta region and beyond. The Center will focus on important research fields in both pure and applied mathematics. Its primary goal is to promote the basic research in mathematics and advance interdisciplinary research of mathematics in life science, information science, engineering, and finance, etc.
 </p><p>
The governing of the Center will be in accordance with international standards for major international mathematics centers. It provides first-class research environment for researchers and visitors alike, hosting annual thematic programs and focused research groups.
